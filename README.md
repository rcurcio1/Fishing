## Fishing Game
#### by Ross Curcio
A fishing game where one can travel to different locations, each with specific species that can be caught. Fish can be sold to get money to upgrade your rod and buy lures. 

#### IDEAS
    
1. Cost to travel to new location
2. Possibility to catch junk / special locational items
3. Lure ideas
    * Rarer fish
    * Larger fish
4. Create a state class so that the game can be started paused and then started from the same place
5. Unlock medals for catching all fish in location, certain achievements, etc 
6. "Final boss" type fish unlocked in location when all other fish are caught
